# Data on HPC schedulers

What's the most popular HPC scheduler?  I asked this question on twitter https://twitter.com/walkingrandomly/status/1254004819490201600 and started collating the data here.  

It's very incomplete and PRs are welcome

## Top 500 systems

* [Top500.csv](./top500.csv)

## University Systems

* [Academic.csv](./academic.csv)

## Other systems

What might go here?

**The schedulers**
